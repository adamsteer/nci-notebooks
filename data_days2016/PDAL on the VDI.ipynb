    "\n",
    "PDAL (the **Point Data Abstraction Library**) is an open source library for handling massive point data sets. It's name is derived from GDAL - since it aims to sit in the same space for point data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDAL is actually a C library - if you're writing applications you can insert it into your code. It also has python bindings. Today we'll explore some of PDAL's capabilities using it's command line applications - which are mostly wrappers to PDAL's **pipeline** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also us a sneaky bit of LibLAS: http://www.liblas.org\n",
    "\n",
    "...but you'll hopefully see why we'd prefer PDAL in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would I use PDAL? Why is it here on data day?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deal with:\n",
    "- LiDAR elevation observations\n",
    "- 3D photogrammetry\n",
    "- Any other data which consists of dense, ungridded points\n",
    "\n",
    "...PDAL can make your life a lot simpler with some basic processing tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "PDAL is demonstrated at this workshop because point data exist on NCI's filesystem, and the VDI is the perfect place to work on them without having to ship unneccessary data. Using the VDI as a front end for development is an excellent way to protoype point data analyses on data that exist in the NCI filesystem; or define specific subsets to take away for analysis."
