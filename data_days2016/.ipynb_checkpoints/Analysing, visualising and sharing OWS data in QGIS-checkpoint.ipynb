    "\n",
    "QGIS (Quantum GIS) is an application for geospatial data analysis and visualisation, focussed on 2D (raster and vector) datasets, and wrapped in a straightforward graphical user interface. It can also be used as a Python library, but for this session we use the GUI.\n",

    "### I have [insert many other tools] on the VDI - why use QGIS?\n",

    "\n",
    "We hope to demonstrate some ways which QGIS can help you quickly develop shareable, multi-source analyses quickly and simply. We also revise some web service principles."
