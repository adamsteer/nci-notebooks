    "\n",
    "QGIS (Quantum GIS) is an application for geospatial data analysis and visualisation, focussed on 2D (raster and vector) datasets, and wrapped in a straightforward graphical user interface. It can also be used as a Python library, but for this session we use the graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. I have [insert many other tools] on the VDI - why use QGIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "QGIS can be used on the VDI as a rapid-prototyping tool. If you've got all the infrastructure you need available in your project space and don't need it, that's great!\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to demonstrate some ways which QGIS can help you quickly develop shareable, multi-source analyses quickly and simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. What  is the general approach of this exercise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've just run a model or synthesised some new analytical data and want to quickly compare your results with other data sources, inspect the results, and share with colleagues - essentially create a visualisation you can demonstrate."

    "\n",
    "1. We will obtain elevation data from the SRTM national mosaic using **WCS**. The assumption here is that we can find data via the NCI service catalogues more easily than on the file system. \n",
    "2. We will obtain tree cover data from a NetCDF file held on the NCI file system. We assume that this is your own data, that may not be published anywhere yet.\n",
    "3. For the cadastral data, we will request vector data not held at NCI using a web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WCS request uses only a web browser. For filesystem data we use the NetCDF operators (**NCO**, http://nco.sourceforge.net/) to subset and manipulate our data. And for external web service requests we will use **QGIS** native capabilities to ingest data."
