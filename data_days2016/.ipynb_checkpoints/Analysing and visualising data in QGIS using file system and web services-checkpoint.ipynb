    "\n",
    "QGIS (Quantum GIS) is an application for geospatial data analysis and visualisation, focussed on 2D (raster and vector) datasets, and wrapped in a straightforward graphical user interface. It can also be used as a Python library, but for this session we use the GUI.\n",

    "### I have [insert many other tools] on the VDI - why use QGIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "QGIS can be used on the VDI as a rapid-prototyping tool. If you've got all the infrastructure you need available in your project space and don't need it, that's great!\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to demonstrate some ways which QGIS can help you quickly develop shareable, multi-source analyses quickly and simply. We also revise some web service principles."
